Welcome!

This desktop web app is a platform that serves D&D (Dragons & Dungeons) players that usually meet their friends to play using a physical map board, and currently need to play online using a shared online map board because of the Covid-19 outbreak.

It was written by Sapir Zeelon in March-April, 2020.
I created this app while independently learning all of the relevant material online in order to do what I love and become a full-stack or a frond-end developer.
The app was developed using these technologies:
React, Node.js, React-Hooks, SCSS, CSS, REST API, Express, ES6, MongoDB, Jest, Enzyme, sinon, VS Code.

- I've transformed several components to use React-Hooks to demonstrate my knowledge in both methods.
- The components written using hooks are: LoginForm, RegistrationForm and ForgotPasswordForm.

It is up and running at:
https://wwwsapir.github.io/dnd-online-board/

The REST API back-end server is up on Heroku, and the source code is at:
https://github.com/wwwsapir/dnd-online-board-api

Enjoy!
